## Owner

The contract owner, identified as "clokten.btc", has privileges to initialize the contract and manage its operations.

## Initial Supply

The contract initializes with an initial supply of 5 ClokTen tokens in the liquidity pool.

## Fees

The contract does not implement any fees for swaps or liquidity provision.

## Instructions
